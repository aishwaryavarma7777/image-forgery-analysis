Image forgery detection is challenging due to the advancements in image editing software. Traditional methods for detecting image forgery are often hand-crafted and may not be able to generalize well to new types of forgeries. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be effective in a wide range of image recognition tasks, and they have also been shown to be promising for image forgery detection. This report reviews the use of CNNs for image forgery detection. The main objective of this project is to analyze algorithms and technologies that can automatically identify manipulated or forged images. Ensuring the authenticity and credibility of digital content is crucial to combat the growing concern of fake images circulating online.
